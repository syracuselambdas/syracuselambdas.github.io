                 <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170821041822/http://lambdaphiepsilon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lambda Phi Epsilon</a> was founded on February 25, 1981, by principal founder Master Craig Ishigo and a group of eighteen other dedicated men on the campus of the University of California of Los Angeles. Noting that Asian fraternities and sororities at the UC campuses were recognized only as service organizations due to their memberships focus on specific Asian groups and to the exclusion of other ethnic groups, the goal of the founders was to transcend this limitation. The founders hoped to set new and higher standards of excellence for all Asian-interest organizations to follow, while feeling a need to offer a fraternity that would be recognized by the IFC and the Greek system.</p>
                
                <p>While the original charter focused on Asian Pacific Americans, people from all ethnic backgrounds were welcome to join and support the brotherhood of Lambda Phi Epsilon. Their vision was that the members would eventually become the leaders of their respective communities and bridge the gaps that divided the Asian American community through an affiliation with a common organization. Master Craig Ishigo and Darryl L. Mu signed the charter as president and vice president, respectively. Unknowingly, their efforts had set the stage for the emergence of the largest organization of its kind. To this very day, Lambda Phi Epsilon exists as the only international Asian American interest fraternity to be recognized by both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170821041822/http://www.nicindy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North-American Interfraternity Conference</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170821041822/http://www.napahq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Panhellenic Association</a>.</p>
                
                <p>In early fall of 2014, a group of ambitious, bold, and entrepreneurial men from varied backgrounds assembled to form an interest group for the world’s largest Asian interest fraternity at Syracuse University. They went about choosing to name their interest group &#8220;Prestige&#8221; to illustrate the type of reputation they want their values and outcomes to reflect. Although most of them started out as complete strangers, they quickly forged a bond of brotherhood that strengthened over time as their lofty ideas transformed into tangible feats. Through hosting meaningful service events, facilitating cultural exchanges, and engaging in activist dialogue over the past four months, the interest group enriched the lives of their fellow students and community members. On the morning of March 28, 2015, seven crusading charters established the Charter Class of Syracuse University Lambda Phi Epsilon. A probate show was held on campus on April 4, 2015 to formally introduce the new charters to their multicultural Greek system.</p>

                 <p>Lambda Phi Epsilon is an organization that will challenge every aspect of your college life. The road to becoming a brother of Lambda Phi Epsilon is not easy as it requires drive and dedication towards achieving the organization’s various goals, but the rewards are well worth it. New members enter into a brotherhood that is rich in tradition and strong in its bonds while learning how to become a leader in their schools, their communities, and the real world. It takes a certain type of man to become a Lambda—someone who wants to become a leader among men.</p>
                 <p>Perhaps that’s you.</p>
                 <p>Many brothers have said that the reason they joined Lambda Phi Epsilon was because they could see and feel a sense of brotherhood among the existing members that they could not find elsewhere. However, the brotherhood extends far beyond the reach of a single school. With chapters across the country, brothers have a chance to network with others from all over, bringing with it many new opportunities and friendships. Membership does not end with the undergraduate years. Numerous alumni associations exist all across the country, bringing both newly graduated brothers and those with more experience in the real world to continue their contribution to society.</p>
                 <p>Lambda Phi Epsilon not only seeks to bring together a diverse group of men who share common interests, concerns, backgrounds, and cultures, but those who show the confidence of a leader. This leadership is pivotal in achieving the goals of the fraternity, which include servicing the community through various philanthropies, increasing Asian awareness, promoting academic scholarship, and strengthening the Asian American voice in the community. Each brother has a vital role in making these goals attainable, and the principles that they learn are passed down to new members in hopes that they will become the next generation of leaders among men.</p>
